Test Suite
==========

To add an example to the test suite, update the `DEFAULT_TESTS` line
in the `Makefile` with your example number, make a new directory
`example_NN/` with the example `.v` files, and make a
`run-example-NN.sh` file based on the commented template
`run-example-00.sh`.  You can look at the other `run-example-NN.sh`
files for inspiration on simpler tests to write.
