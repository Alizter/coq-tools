* Try using delta-debugging, and being smarter about ordering of
  removals

* Remember timing information for definitions, so we can be smart
  about prioritizing things that take a long time.

* Separate things into more files

* Consider skipping changes that make compilation much slower (e.g.,
  removing a quick-path instance).  Maybe make a tuning parameter for
  how much size needs to be reduced to accept a given reduction in
  speed.

* Use `coqtop -time -emacs` rather than `coqtop -emacs`, and remove
  the need to split into statements.  Alternatively, use `coqc -q -I
  . -time -verbose -dump-globs foo.glob foo`

* Deal with [Load] better

* Handle subdirectories better

* Rename "hint removal" to something more accurate

* Add info about how many files were combined to the header, and keep
  track of original line count across multiple runs (e.g., turn the
  header into "(* File reduced by coq-bug-finder from $n lines,
  originally $m files and $o lines, to $p lines. *)", and parse it to
  preserve the "originally ...," part).
