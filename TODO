* Only display the warning about periods in strings if there are
  actually periods in strings.

* Try using delta-debugging, and being smarter about ordering of
  removals

* Make look-ahead for variables section-specific

* Remember timing information for definitions, so we can be smart
  about prioritizing things that take a long time.

* Separate things into more files

* Consider skipping changes that make compilation much slower (e.g.,
  removing a quick-path instance).  Maybe make a tuning parameter for
  how much size needs to be reduced to accept a given reduction in
  speed.

* Use `coqtop -time -emacs` rather than `coqtop -emacs`, and remove
  the need to split into statements.
